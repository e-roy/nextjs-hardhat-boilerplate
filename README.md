# NextJS and Hardhat Boilerplate

This is a simple boilerplate with NextJS and Hardhat. This repo creates 2 seperate environments, one for the app (NextJS) and another for writing and testing contracts (Hardhat).

The idea of this boilerplate, is to create a quick starting point for writing and testing contracts in hardhat, and have a front-end that can interact with the deployed contracts.

## Commands:

Install packages for both hardhat and NextJS environments

```shell
yarn
```

To start the dev environment for hardhat:

```shell
yarn chain
```

In a 2nd terminal, for deploying contracts:

```shell
yarn deploy
```

In a 3rd terminal to start the dev server on your network:

```shell
yarn dev
```
